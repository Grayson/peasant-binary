			<p>
				This is a small app to explore how binary values for a
				given number can be generated through a process of successive
				halving of the number and noting instances of odd numbers.  I
				discovered this method
				<a href="https://twitter.com/buzz/status/1447968191523672067/">
					from a tweet</a>
				that discovered it in a book written by Frank Herbert,
				author of Dune.  I hadn't heard of this method so I built this
				app to explore it.
